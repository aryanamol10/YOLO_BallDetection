May need to adjust the following values:
  FOCAL_POINT: Calibrated pretty quickly but needs some refinement
  IMG_WIDTH: Set to your actual camera width
  conversion_factor: for different unit conversions

NOTE: Code may be laggy and detect other circular objects outside of balls you are detecting.
